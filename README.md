# Advanced-SQL-Task-Collection

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries that I have practiced to enhance my skills in data analysis and database management. Each query is designed to address specific business analysis tasks, such as calculating total sales, ranking orders, finding sales deviations, and calculating moving averages across product sales. The tasks leverage advanced SQL features such as window functions, aggregation, ranking, and partitioning to extract meaningful insights from large datasets. Below are the questions I worked on:

## 1.Find the sales across all products.
## 2.Rank each order based on their sales from highest to lowest.
Find the total number of orders for each customer.
Find the percentage contribution of each product's sales to the total sales.
Find the average sales across all orders and for each product.
Find the average scores of customers.
Find all orders where sales are higher than the average sales across all orders.
Find the highest and lowest sales across all orders and for each product.
Find the deviation of each sale from the minimum and maximum sales amounts.
Calculate the moving average of sales for each product over time.
Calculate the rolling moving average of sales for each product over time.
These tasks demonstrate my proficiency in SQL and my ability to transform raw data into actionable business intelligence. The queries are structured to solve real-world problems, providing insights like sales breakdowns, customer analysis, and product performance metrics.
